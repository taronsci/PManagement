Idea 1. Specialized online store - services bought and sold for currency (time credits?).

you can do a service to get currenc
you can use currency to get a service

-What kind of app would it be?

It would be a web app where users can post, find and exchange household services. The users can either pay with money or earn credits by providing their own services. There would be a rating system to evaluate the person.

-Who is this project for?

Individuals who need household services, such as repairs, cleaning, and any service related to a house (or apartment): cleaning windows, fixing broken appliances, remodelling, babysitting, etc.

Individuals who are willing to offer their services for money or credits.

-What needs will it satisfy?

1) It will make finding a handyman (or woman) who can help you easier. You will not have to ask around to find out who is the best in town, you can just look on the app and find the person you need.

2) It also creates an opportunity for skilled individuals to present their talents and make themselves be known.



Idea 2. Specialized online store - bookstore with trading functionality.(This idea was chosen)

-What kind of app would it be?

It will be a web app where users can buy-sell, rent-borrow, exchange, and give away books. The platform will act as both a marketplace and a community hub, enabling people to access books in flexible and affordable ways.

-Who is this project for?

This project is for anyone who wants to buy-sell, rent-borrow, exchange, or give away books. It is also for anyone who wants to read a book, and may want to/cannot buy the books they want to read due to financial or space limitations.

-What needs will it satisfy?

The app will address several challengers readers face today:
1) Accessibility to rare works: Finding books of specific authors can be difficult, especially if the authors works are out of print. 
2) Affordability of international books (not sold in the country): Some foreign books aren't sold locally, and importing them in can get expensive.

3) Flexible access to books: Not everyone wants to (or is able to) own or keep everything they read. Selling, renting, exchanging, or receiving books as give always provides cost and space effective options for readers.


        Scope of MVP
1. User management 

Register/login (username, email, password).

CRUD for user profile.

2. Book listings

CRUD for books: title, author, year, genre, condition, type of transaction (sth like this)

Types of transaction are separate categories:

Sell (with price field)

Rent (with rental duration field)

Exchange (mark as exchangeable)

Giveaway (mark as free)

3. Requests/transactions

Allow one user to request a book from another (e.g., request to buy, rent, exchange, or accept giveaway).

Book owner can accept or decline the request.

Once accepted, mark the book as "unavailable" (basic transaction status).

4. Search/Filter 

By title (partial match)

By author (partial match)

By type of transaction (SELL, RENT, EXCHANGE, GIVEAWAY)

By condition (new, used, etc.)

    Nice to have
bundles for books - multiple books in a single offer

wishlist - user posts what books they would be interested in
